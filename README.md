# 100 Days of DSA with Java

This repository contains my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java over 100 days. Each day, I'll solve problems, write code, and document my progress. By the end of the challenge, I aim to have a solid understanding of DSA and be prepared for coding interviews.

## Goals
1. **Build a strong foundation** in Data Structures and Algorithms using Java.
2. **Solve at least 2 problems daily** to improve problem-solving skills.
3. **Master advanced algorithms** like recursion, dynamic programming, graphs, etc.
4. **Document progress** daily with clear solutions and explanations.
5. **Complete mock contests** and coding challenges to simulate real interview conditions.
6. **Track learning and progress** to stay motivated and on course for the entire 100 days.

## Folder Structure
- `Day1/`: Java Basics (e.g., variables, loops)
- `Day2/`: Arrays problems (e.g., reverse array, find max/min)
- ...
- `Day100/`: Final problem-solving and mock contests

## Progress Tracker
- [x] **Day 1**: Completed loops and solved 2 problems.
- [x] **Day 2**: Solved 3 array problems.
- [ ] **Day 3**: Started recursion.

*The Progress Tracker is updated daily to track what Iâ€™ve completed.*
